## Project Proposal Brainstorming Prompts

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
**Answer:** The most fascinating topic that we've delved into this quarter concerns the exploration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). What captivates me is not just the variety of models within the GNN umbrella, such as Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), but the underlying mathematical principles that enable these models to effectively capture and leverage the structure of graph data. Understanding the theoretical aspects, like how these models aggregate neighbor information or how attention mechanisms are applied in GATs, has been incredibly enlightening and is something I am eager to explore further.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
**Answer:** My primary focus for the upcoming Quarter 2 Project is to enhance the accuracy of the GNN models that I've developed over the current term. Specifically, I aim to refine the architectures of GAT, GIN, and GCN models to improve their predictive performance. This would involve experimenting with different hyperparameters, integrating novel layers or mechanisms, and employing advanced training techniques. By systematically fine-tuning these models, I aspire to push the boundaries of what GNNs can achieve in terms of accuracy on complex graph-based datasets.

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
**Answer:** Reflecting on the approach taken during Quarter 1, I've recognized a significant oversight in not conducting thorough data analysis. To rectify this, I intend to implement comprehensive data validation steps moving forward. This will involve scrutinizing the datasets for inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers to ensure data quality. I believe that establishing a robust data preprocessing pipeline is crucial for the integrity of the model training process and, ultimately, the accuracy of the predictions made by the GNN models.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
**Answer:** In addition to expanding my expertise in GNN models, I am particularly keen on integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into my project. My previous internship exposed me to the use of CNNs in image recognition tasks, and I am interested in investigating how the convolutional layers' ability to capture local features in images can be translated to graph data. By experimenting with hybrid models that combine the strengths of GNNs and CNNs, I aim to explore innovative approaches to modeling graph-structured data, potentially leading to breakthroughs in fields such as healthcare data science.
